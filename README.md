### Contributing

You need a Vercel account that you can create for free at https://vercel.com/signup.
In case you have a free account, you need to change `maxDuration` in the `functions` section of `vercel.json` to a max allowed value for free accounts: `10`.

Install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) and run `vercel dev`. Currently not supported on Windows, see (https://github.com/lucacasonato/now-deno/issues/12)
